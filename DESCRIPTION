Description: The goal of geodaData is to store sample spatial datasets. These 
    datasets are intended to be used to teach basic spatial analysis concepts. 
    They are used in the weekly R Spatial Workshop at the Center for Spatial Data 
    Science at UChicago, and are based off of the GeoDa workbook and data site 
    developed by Luc Anselin and team. Datasets are stored in the sf object format.
